To create an advanced analytical system that provides deep insights into product sales, market trends, and customer behavior using a combination of data engineering, AI, machine learning, business analytics, and data analysis techniques.

# Data Ingestion and Engineering for Product Sales Analysis

This project implements a comprehensive ETL pipeline to ingest, clean, and transform sales, customer feedback, and competitor data for advanced product sales analysis.

## Data Sources

- Sales Data : Collected from online sales (e-commerce APIs), in-store sales (POS systems).
- Customer Feedback : Gathered from social media (Twitter API, Reddit API), and review sites (Yelp, Google Reviews).
- Competitor Data : Web scraped from competitor websites or gathered via public APIs for pricing and promotions.

## Technologies Used

- Apache Spark : For big data processing and ETL operations.
- AWS S3 : For scalable, durable storage of both raw and processed data.
- AWS Glue : For orchestration of ETL jobs.

## Pipeline Flow

1. Data Ingestion : Data is collected from various sources and stored in S3 raw data buckets.
2. ETL with Spark : Data is processed, cleaned, and transformed.
3. Output : Cleaned data is written back to S3 for further analysis or visualization.

## How to Run

1. Setup Environment :
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Configure AWS credentials and ensure access to S3.

2. Ingest Data :
   - Run ingestion scripts in `ingestion_scripts/` to fetch data from APIs or scrape websites.

3. ETL Process :
   - Execute `main_etl_pipeline.py` to start the ETL process using Spark.

4. AWS Glue :
   - Use `glue_job.py` for scheduling and running ETL jobs in AWS environment.

## Code Snippets

### Sales Data Ingestion

```python
import json
import boto3
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SalesDataETL").getOrCreate()

# AWS S3 client for uploading data
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def fetch_sales_data():
    # Example: Fetch from an e-commerce API or POS system
    # Here, we simulate data with a JSON file
    with open('data/sales_data.json', 'r') as f:
        sales_data = json.load(f)
    return spark.createDataFrame(sales_data)

def upload_to_s3(df, bucket, key):
    df.write.parquet(f"s3://{bucket}/{key}", mode="append")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sales_df = fetch_sales_data()
    upload_to_s3(sales_df, "your-sales-bucket", "raw/sales/")
